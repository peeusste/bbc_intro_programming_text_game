# Practical exercise
# Create two variables for two people's names and two for their ages. Assign them some values
# Print out their names, ages and combined age

person1 = "Sam"
age_person1 = 23
person2 = "Suri"
age_person2 = 35

print(person1, "is", age_person1) 
print(person2, "is", age_person2) 
print("Their combined age is", age_person1 + age_person2)

''' 
#Could also do
combined_age = age_person1 + age_person2
print("Their combined age is", combined_age)
