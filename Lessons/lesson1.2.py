# Print out their names, ages and combined age

person1 = "Sam"
agePerson1 = 23
person2 = "Suri"
agePerson2 = 35

print(person1, "is", agePerson1) 
print(person2, "is", agePerson2) 
print("Their combined age is", agePerson1 + agePerson2)

'''

combinedAge = agePerson1 + agePerson2
print("Their combined age is", combinedAge)
