# Programming for Non-Programmers

The [wiki](https://github.com/peeusste/bbc_intro_programming_text_game/wiki) contains the lessons where we will learn Programming for Non-Programmers using the Python language.

At the end of each lesson section there is a very short coding challenge. After you've had a go at the challenge you can compare your answer with the code in the corresponding [Lesson](https://github.com/peeusste/bbc_intro_programming_text_game/tree/main/Lessons) folder in GitHub. (Please don't look at the code until you've had a decent attempt at the challenge)

And then, at the end of each full lesson there is a summary and a discussion about how that lesson relates to the code that's to be developed in the text adventure game.

So, [let's get coding](https://github.com/peeusste/bbc_intro_programming_text_game/wiki/).
